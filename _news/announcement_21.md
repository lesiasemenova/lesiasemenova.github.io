We got two papers accepted to NeurIPS this year on the trustworthiness of Rashomon sets: [ElliCE: Efficient and Provably Robust Algorithmic Recourse via the Rashomon Sets](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=GNDgQie8W4) <strong>(Spotlight)</strong> and [The Rashomon Set Has It All: Analyzing Trustworthiness of Trees under Multiplicity](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RXsDPn3toF). Congratulations to Bohdan, Iryna, Ethan, and Tony!
