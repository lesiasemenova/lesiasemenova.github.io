We got two papers accepted to NeurIPS this year on the trustworthiness of Rashomon sets: ElliCE: Efficient and Provably Robust Algorithmic Recourse via the Rashomon Sets (Spotlight) and Trustworthy Models without Specialized Optimization: What the Rashomon Set Already Offers. Congratulations to Bohdan, Iryna, Ethan, and Tony!
