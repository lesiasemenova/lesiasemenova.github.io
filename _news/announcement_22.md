I’m co-organizing a [workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/rashomon-aaai-workshop) and a [tutorial](https://sites.google.com/view/rashomon-aaai-tutorial/) on the Rashomon Effect at AAAI 2026. If you’re planning to attend the conference, I’d love to see you there—and encourage you to consider submitting to the workshop.
