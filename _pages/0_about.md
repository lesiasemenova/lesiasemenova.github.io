<!--I am a computer scientist currently working as an Assitant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University. Prior, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, NYC and received my doctorate from the Computer Science Department at Duke University. My research interests span machine learning, responsible and trustworthy AI, interpretability, human-centered design, AI in healthcare, reinforcement learning, and reasoning. I am especially interested in developing tools and pipelines to facilitate informed decision-making in high-stakes decision domains, as well as theoretically explaining phenomena that we often observe in practice.

Before joining Duke, I worked for two years on the Augmented Reality team at Samsung Research and Development Institute Ukraine. I received my M.S. and B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Department of Computer Science and Cybernetics. I was selected as one of the 2024 Rising Stars in Computational and Data Sciences and received outstanding thesis rewards from Duke University.-->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
