I am a computer scientist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, NYC. In Fall 2025, I will join the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University as an Assistant Professor. I received my doctorate from the Computer Science Department at Duke University. My research interests span machine learning, responsible and trustworthy AI, interpretability, human-centered design, AI in healthcare, reinforcement learning, and reasoning. I am especially interested in developing tools and pipelines to facilitate informed decision-making in high-stakes decision domains, as well as theoretically explaining phenomena that we often observe in practice.

Before joining Duke, I worked for two years on the Augmented Reality team at Samsung Research and Development Institute Ukraine. I received my M.S. and B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Department of Computer Science and Cybernetics. I was selected as one of the 2024 Rising Stars in Computational and Data Sciences.

<p class="important-announcement">  I am currently recruiting students at Rutgers. If you're interested in collaborating or joining my group, please take a look at <a href="/_pages/prospective_students.md">this page</a>.</p>
